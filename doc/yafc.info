Overview
********

   This manual documents YAFC. YAFC is quite a powerful ftp client.  It
is a console interface to the ftp protocol. If you're looking for a nice
GUI client, Yafc is not for you. If you, however, use ftp often and
want a fast, powerful, friendly client Yafc is here for you...

   Some of the features are recursive get/put/ls/rm, nohup transfers,
colored ls, cached directory listings, autologin and bookmarks,
powerful aliases and extensive tab completion.

   To my knowledge, Yafc is the only ftp client that has colored ls.

   This manual is incomplete, and possibly out of date. If you would
like to improve this manual, please send a message to
<mhe@stacken.kth.se>.

Bugs
----

   Please report bugs to <mhe@stacken.kth.se>.  Before reporting a bug,
please verify you're using the latest version (check the ftp site.) You
can get the version number of your copy of yafc with the command `yafc
--version'.

   When reporting bugs, please include information on what machine and
operating system, including versions, you are running, an example for
me to reproduce (use the `--trace' option) and a patch if you have one.

File: yafc.info,  Node: Motivation,  Prev: Obtaining Yafc,  Up: Overview

Motivation
----------

   Yafc was created because I needed a good ftp client.  The standard
BSD ftp client lacks tab completion, something I've become used to and
can't live without. Of course, both Lftp and NcFtp has tab completion,
but not good enough for me :-). Also, I needed a client that understood
Kerberos4 authentication, because that's the security system used a KTH
(The Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, where I am studying.)

   But perhaps most important, I needed a fun project to work on :-)

Invoking Yafc
*************

   Usage:
     yafc [options] [ftp://][USER[:PASSWORD]@]HOSTNAME[:PORT][/DIRECTORY]

   Options:

`-a'
`--anon'
     Try an anonymous login, ie login as "anonymous" and prompt for
     password.  Your email address (or password set in the config file
     with "anon_password") is printed as default. Press enter to accept
     it.

`-d'
`--debug'
     Print all messages sent to/from server.

`-D'
`--dump-rc'
     Prints the default configuration file to standard output.

`-k'
`--nokrb'
     Don't try Kerberos4 authentication when logging in to the host
     specified on the command line.

`-K'
`--krb'
     Try Kerberos4 authentication when logging in to the host specified
     on the command line. This will override any 'nokrb' options in
     `yafcrc' or `bookmarks'.

`-n'
`--norc'
     Do not read the users configuration file. This will cause yafc to
     use its default settings.

`-N'
`--nonetrc'
     Do not read `~/.netrc' for additional autologin information.

`-p'
`--noproxy'
     Do not connect via the proxy. This should be used if connection to
     a host on the local network.

`-q'
`--quiet'
     Do not print the welcome message with copyright information when
     starting Yafc.

`-r FILE'
`--rcfile=FILE'
     Read another configuration file.

`-t FILE'
`--trace[=FILE]'
     Enable creation of trace file. Trace files are mainly for
     debugging and includes every response and command Yafc
     receives/sends. If FILE is specified, use that file instead of the
     default trace file (`~/.yafc/trace/trace.pid', where pid is the
     process id number of Yafc.) Trace files can grow quite large and
     can safely be deleted.

`-u'
`--noauto'
     Do not login automagically to the host specified on the command
     line. You can still use bookmark aliases, though.

`-U'
`--noalias'
     As --noauto, but bookmark aliases is disabled (for host on command
     line).

`-v'
`--verbose'
     Print all responses received (without response code.)

`-w'
`--wait=TIME'
     Use a different time to wait between connection attempts, in
     seconds.  This overrides the value set by `connect_wait_time' in
     the configuration file, *Note connect_wait_time::.

`-W'
`--workdir=DIR'
     Use a different working directory for configuration files and
     temporary files. Default is `~/.yafc'.

`-V'
`--version'
     Print version information on stdout and exit successfully.

`-h'
`--help'
     Print a short help description on stdout and exit successfully.

The shell
*********

   Yafc presents the user with an internal shell. Command redirection
is available, using the conventional shell syntax (eg `cat foo.txt >
foo' will copy the remote file foo.txt to the local file foo.) Input
redirection, however, is not supported. Also asynchronous mode is not
supported. The following will thus be rejected: `ls |emacs &' or `open
< login.foo'.

Nohup transfers
===============

   get and put has an option `--nohup'. When given, Yafc will fork
itself to the background and continue to transfer the specified files,
allowing you to use your shell or even logout. Output is redirected to
the file `~/.yafc/nohup/nohup.pid', or to file specified by option
`--logfile=FILE'.  Combine this option with `--parents' and `--force'
or `--unique' to get the best results.

   If you have tagged any files (with the `tag' command, see *Note
tag::), add the option `--tagged' to the get command to transfer those
files too.  There is an equivalent command for local files and put,
namely `ltag'.

   Yafc will also enter nohup mode upon receipt of `SIGHUP'.

   Set NOHUP_MAILADDRESS in the yafcrc file to a valid mail address if
you want to receive a mail notifying you when the transfer is complete.


File: yafc.info,  Node: Configuration,  Next: Bookmarks,  Prev: The shell,  Up: Top

Configuration
*************

   Yafc will parse a system-wide configuration file, `/etc/yafcrc',
first. Then, personal settings are read from `~/.yafc/yafcrc'.

   The `--dump-rc' option of Yafc can be used to dump the default
configuration file on standard output.

   Yafc also looks for `~/.netrc', and reads autologin information from
that file. *Note read_netrc::. This file is also used by the standard
ftp client.

   Yafc uses the Readline library to read commands from the terminal,
and Readline can be configured via the `~/.inputrc' file. In this file
you can put keybindings and Readline-oriented options. You can use
`$yafc' for conditional parsing of the `~/.inputrc' file.  A sample
inputrc file is included in the distribution.

--------------

   Xterm window titles

   same codes as for the prompts, see *Note prompt1::.

   This is an excerpt from the Xterm-title mini-HOWTO:
     Many people find it useful to set the title of a terminal to
     reflect dynamic information, such as the name of the host the user
     is logged into, the current working directory, etc.

     This may be done by using XTerm escape sequences. The following
     sequences are useful in this respect:

    `ESC]0;_string_BEL'
          Set icon name and window title to _string_

    `ESC]1;_string_BEL'
          Set icon name to _string_

    `ESC]2;_string_BEL'
          Set window title to _string_

     where `ESC' is the _escape_ character (\033), and `BEL' is the
     _bell_ character (\007).

     _Note_: these sequences apply to most xterm derivatives, such as
     nxterm, color-xterm and rxvt. Other terminal types often use
     different escapes; see the appendix for examples. For the full
     list of xterm escape sequences see the file ctlseq2.txt, which
     comes with the xterm distribution, or xterm.seq, which comes with
     the rxvt distribution.

     These escapes really need to be applied every time the prompt
     changes.  This way the string is updated with every command you
     issue and can keep track of information such as current working
     directory, username, hostname, etc.

   Example: `xterm_title1 "\e]0Yafc\x07"' sets the xterm window title
and icon name to `Yafc'.

Autologin
=========

   Documentation missing...

   The autologin information is stored in much the same way as in the
`~/.netrc' file used by stock ftp, except that the macdef option is not
supported.

   An entry must begin with a `machine', `default' or `local' keyword.

* Menu:

* Autologin keywords::          keywords for autologin
* Autologin examples::          examples


File: yafc.info,  Node: Autologin keywords,  Next: Autologin examples,  Up: Autologin

Autologin keywords
------------------

`machine'
     Specify the hostname to connect to or a domainname. The hostname
     can be a valid FTP URL, including username, password, etc. In that
     case there is no need to specify the corresponding keywords. Using
     the URL syntax is the only way to specify a non-standard port.

     Domainnames should begin with a period, as in `.kth.se'. This will
     match any hostname on that domain, except for hostnames explicitly
     mentioned with another `machine' keyword.  You can not specify an
     alias name for a domain entry.

`alias'
     Specifies another (verbose) name for the bookmark, like `ruby'
     instead of `ftp.netlab.co.jp'. This is the name that will be shown
     in the tab completion list. Valid only after a `machine' statement.

`local'
     If an entry begins with `local', it specifies how to login to all
     ocal machines. Local machines are unqualified hostnames (ie,
     hostnames without a period.)

     This can be overridden with an entry for a specific machine.

`default'
     The `default' entry is used when no other `machine' or `local'
     keyword matched. It can be used to login anonymously to all
     unknown sites.

`login'
     Specify the username.

`anonymous'
     Try an anonymous login, uses ANON_PASSWORD.

`password'
     Specify the password, if required.

`account'
     Specify account name. Not fully supported, anyone using it?

`cwd'
     This keyword specifies a startup directory on the remote server.
     Yafc changes the current directory when logged in.

`prot'
     The prot keyword sets the Kerberos data protection level.  Valid
     protection levels are `safe', `clear' and `private'.

     This is a no-op if not compiled with Kerberos.

`nokrb'
     Do no try to authenticate using Kerberos.


File: yafc.info,  Node: Autologin examples,  Prev: Autologin keywords,  Up: Autologin

Autologin examples

     a '.')

`machine .foo.bar.se login niels'
     login as 'niels' on all hosts on .foo.bar.se domain

`machine dent.foo.bar.se login slartibartfast cwd ~/fjord'
     login as 'slartibartfast' on dent.foo.bar.se and start in
     directory ~/fjord

`machine slartibartfast@dent.foo.bar.se/fjord'
     identical to the example above, but using an ftp URL instead

`machine ftp.gurka.com:4711 anonymous'
     login as 'anonymous' and automagically supply password from
     anon_password, connect on non-standard port 4711

`machine mayer.physto.se anonymous cwd /pub/yafc alias yafc'
     login anonymously to machine mayer.physto.se with other name yafc

Aliases
=======

   Just like in the shell, you can create aliases for commands you use
often, with options you like.

   Aliases can be defined in the configuration file or directly on the
command line. Aliases defined on the command line are only valid in the
current session. *Note alias::.

   The best way to explain aliases, I think, is to look at some
examples:

* Menu:

* Alias examples::              examples on aliases


File: yafc.info,  Node: Alias examples,  Up: Aliases

Alias examples
--------------

`alias ls "ls -F --color"'
     Override the command `ls' to be expanded to `ls -F --color'.  Any
     arguments given to the new `ls' alias will be appended.

`alias ll "ls -l"'
     `ll' will be expanded to `ls -l', regardless if there is an alias
     for plain `ls' like the one above. Aliases can't be nested.

`alias ls list'
     Override the command `ls' to be expanded to the command `list'.
     This is fine, but will generate a warning; `warning: alias 'ls'
     shadows a command with the same name', because the original
     command `ls' is lost and can't be referenced (except through
     another alias.)

`alias pls "ls %1 | less"'
     Create a new command `pls', which lists the contents of a
     directory and pages it through the pager `less'. The `%1' keyword
     is replaced with the first argument to `pls', any other arguments
     will be appended at the end (to the local `less' command.)

`alias pls "ls %* | $PAGER"'
     Create a new command `pls', which lists the contents of a
     directory and pages it through your favourite pager. Any arguments
     given to `pls' will be inserted between ls and the pipe because of
     the `%*' keyword. Using `$PAGER' is fine, it is expanded by the
     ordinary shell.

`alias tget "untag *; tag; get --tagged --verbose --preserve"'
     Create a new command `tget', which untags any tagged files, enters
     the visual tag interface (if Yafc was compiled with the newt
     library), and then transfers any tagged files to the local
     computer (with a couple of other options).   Any options to `tget'
     are appended at the end of the alias (to the `get' command.)

`alias rels "cache --touch %*; ls -F --color %*"'
     Create a new command `rels', which flushes the directories from
     the cache before listing them. Two `%*' sequences are needed to
     insert the arguments at both places.


File: yafc.info,  Node: Colors,  Prev: Aliases,  Up: Configuration

Colors
======

   Escape codes can be used to display colors in the transfer strings
and the prompts.  See *Note transfer_begin_string:: and *Note prompt1::.

   The built-in command `ls' has an option `--color'. You must set the
environment variable LS_COLORS (or LS_COLOURS) for this to work.   See
manpage for GNU ls(1) and *note dircolors: (fileutils)dircolors
invocation, for information how to do this. If you don't set
LS_COLO[U]RS, you can still use the `--color' option, since Yafc
provides some default settings.

* Menu:

* ANSI attribute codes::        Escape codes for attributes


File: yafc.info,  Node: ANSI attribute codes,  Up: Colors

ANSI attribute codes
--------------------

   An ANSI escape sequence has the format `ESC[X;Ym', where `ESC' is
the escape character (octal 033). `X' and, optionally, `Y', is one of
the following escape codes:

   * attribute codes

        - 00 = none

        - 01 = bold

        - 04 = underscore

        - 05 = blink

        - 07 = reverse

        - 08 = concealed


   * text color codes

        - 30 = black

        - 31 = red

        - 32 = green

        - 33 = yellow

        - 34 = blue

        - 35 = magenta

        - 36 = cyan

        - 37 = white


   * background color codes

        - 40 = black

        - 41 = red

        - 42 = green

        - 43 = yellow

        - 44 = blue

        - 45 = magenta

        - 46 = cyan

        - 47 = white



   For example, the sequence `ESC[1;32myafc rulesESC[0m' will be the
string `yafc rules' in bright green, after which the attribute is
restored to normal.

Bookmarks
*********

   Just like creating bookmarks for web pages in a browser, you can
create bookmarks for ftp sites in Yafc. These can later be used for
autologin (*Note autologin::) to that site.

   When connected to an ftp site, use the `bookmark' command to create
a bookmark for that site. If you logged in with a username and
password, Yafc will ask if you want to save the password in the
bookmarks file. If you do, be sure it isn't world readable.  By using
the `auto_bookmark' keyword in the configuration file, Yafc can create
bookmarks automatically for new sites.

   The bookmarks are available to the `open' command, with tab
completion.

********

   If Yafc is compiled with Kerberos, it tries to authenticate using
Kerberos 4 without sending the password in cleartext. For anonymous
logins, Kerberos is never used. The default protection level for data
connections is clear, ie no encryption on transfers. Use the command
`prot' (*Note prot::), to change the data protection level. Valid
arguments are `clear', `safe', and `private'.  Note that confidential
protection is not supported in Kerberos 4.  You can use the `prot'
keyword (*note Autologin keywords::) in the configuration file to
automagically set the protection level for autologin.
