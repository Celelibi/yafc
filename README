DISCLAIMER
----------
This repo started as an import from the original yafc at
http://yafc.sourceforge.net/ but I have no affiliation in any way with the
original project.

The upstream project has seen no activity since 2005, and noone is responsive
in the ml, so I imported it to github to apply some scattered patches and some
fixes of my own.

Even though I no longer use yafc, feel free to send a pull request and I'll do
my best to apply it, but don't expect me to do any active development or fix
any bugs.
