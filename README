NOTE!
This program is in development, so comments are welcome.
Bug reports, and other feedback, should be sent to <yafc-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>.
Read the BUGS and TODO files before reporting a bug/request. Also
make sure you're using the latest version.

Being in development also means that things can change
between versions, eg command options and configuration
keywords; read the NEWS file.

Nevertheless Yafc is quite stable now.
