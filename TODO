TODO list for Yafc
------------------

* insgesamt 679748 (locale settings in listing -> parsing failed)
* if the output can't be parsed, yafc should just dump it out raw.
* yafc ssh://hostname -u ???
* option (in bookmarks?) to control LIST parameters (-a needed for PureFTPd)
* Ctrl-C with SSH breaks ssh program *and* yafc, anyone?
? config option for default answers to questions (get/put/fxp/more?)
* fix --chgrp / --chmod for directories (get)
* ltag should ignore multiples just as tag does
* re-implement setproctitle code
? don't show passwd (from cmdline) in 'ps' (Ari Pollak)
* FTP over SSL support (rfc2228)
* IPv6 support
* keep-alive (send NOOP or similar when idle)
* EPSV and EPRT support (RFC2428)
* problems to get directories with double quotes (") in the name
* completion doesn't work correctly with rels (need to be expanded?)
! improve documentation (help wanted)
* no bugs ;)
