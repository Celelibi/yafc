TODO list for Yafc
------------------

* rc.c: rewrite config file parser
* fix --chgrp / --chmod for directories (get)
* remove more hints from cmds[]
* ls -r doesn't work (no sorting done)
* ltag should ignore multiples just as tag does
* per connection setting for passive mode
* keep-alive (send NOOP or similar when idle)
* IPv6 support
* EPSV and EPRT support (RFC2428)
* LANGuage support (RFC2640)
* problems to get directories with double quotes (") in the name
* completion doesn't work correctly with rels (need to be expanded?)
? timeout on cache entry lifetime (eg, re-read after 3 min?)
! improve documentation (help wanted)
* no bugs ;)
