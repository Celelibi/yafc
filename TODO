TODO list for Yafc
------------------

* 'insgesamt 679748' (locale settings in LISTing -> parsing failed)
? if the output can't be parsed, yafc should just dump it out raw.
+ option (in bookmarks?) to control LIST parameters (-a needed for PureFTPd)
! Ctrl-C with SSH breaks ssh program *and* yafc, anyone?
? config option for default answers to questions (get/put/fxp/...)
* fix --chgrp / --chmod for directories (get)
* ltag should ignore multiples just as tag does
? FTP over SSL support (rfc2228)
+ IPv6 support (help highly appreciated)
? keep-alive (send NOOP or similar when idle)
+ EPSV and EPRT support (RFC2428)
* problems to get directories with double quotes (") in the name
* completion doesn't work correctly with rels (need to be expanded?)
! improve documentation (help wanted)
* no bugs ;)


Legend:

* fix bug
+ add feature
? questionable
! urgent
