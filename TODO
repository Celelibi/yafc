------------------

* SSH2_FXP_READLINK returns wrong length of filename
* Ctrl-C with SSH breaks ssh program *and* yafc
* ssh cmdline option: -o option
* option: do reverse DNS lookups? (Ari Pollak)
? config option for default answers to questions (get/put/fxp/more?)
* fix --chgrp / --chmod for directories (get)
* ltag should ignore multiples just as tag does
* re-implement setproctitle code
? don't show passwd (from cmdline) in 'ps' (Ari Pollak)
* FTP over SSL support
* IPv6 support
* keep-alive (send NOOP or similar when idle)
* EPSV and EPRT support (RFC2428)
? LANGuage support (RFC2640)
* problems to get directories with double quotes (") in the name
* completion doesn't work correctly with rels (need to be expanded?)
? timeout on cache entry lifetime (eg, re-read after 3 min?)
! improve documentation (help wanted)
