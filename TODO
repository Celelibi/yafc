TODO list for Yafc
------------------

_________________
Mark Schreiber (mark7):

yafc can compile a working yafc with Kerberos support on Red Hat 7.2
(with krb-libs installed), but it requires manually enabling the
kerberos options in config.h and adding the paths to the
Makefiles. It'd be nice if autoconf worked with RH's setup. Autoconf
thinks that Heimdall (instead of MIT) is installed and even if mit is
forced by altering configure.in, fails on every test after that.

kerb libs on RH are in /usr/kerberos/lib, includes in
/usr/kerberos/include/krb5 and /usr/kerberos/include/krb5/libs.
------------------


* 'insgesamt 679748' (locale settings in LISTing -> parsing failed)
? if the output can't be parsed, yafc should just dump it out raw.
+ option (in bookmarks?) to control LIST parameters (-a needed for PureFTPd)
! Ctrl-C with SSH breaks ssh program *and* yafc, anyone?
? config option for default answers to questions (get/put/fxp/...)
* fix --chgrp / --chmod for directories (get)
* ltag should ignore multiples just as tag does
? FTP over SSL support (rfc2228)
+ IPv6 support (help highly appreciated)
? keep-alive (send NOOP or similar when idle)
+ EPSV and EPRT support (RFC2428)
* problems to get directories with double quotes (") in the name
* completion doesn't work correctly with rels (need to be expanded?)
! improve documentation (help wanted)
* no bugs ;)


Legend:

* fix bug
+ add feature
? questionable
! urgent
