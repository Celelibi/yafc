TODO list for Yafc
------------------

before 1.0:
-----------

* make autoconf recognize kerberos on redhat 7.2 (Mark Schreiber)
  kerb libs on RH are in /usr/kerberos/lib, includes in
  /usr/kerberos/include/krb5 and /usr/kerberos/include/krb5/libs.
* doesn't compile with socks5 ?
+ fix --chgrp / --chmod for directories (get)
* no bugs ;)


after 1.0:
----------

* check and apply Eduard Blochs large file support patch
* clean up source directory structure
* update autoconf stuff to latest version
* put/get/fxp/rm shouldn't remove tagged items that failed to transfer
  (eg, directories if -r option not given)
* remove [l]untag: create [l]tag --remove file(s) instead
* completion doesn't work correctly with rels (need to be expanded?)
* improve documentation (help wanted)
* Ctrl-C in ssh mode breaks ssh program *and* yafc, anyone?
* look into the 'set' command; only a subset of the settings are
  handled, and they aren't saved either, is it needed?
* 'insgesamt 679748' (locale settings in LISTing -> parsing failed)
   I'm not sure how to fix this
+ a way of passing arguments to ssh (suggested by Tore Anderson)
+ support HTTP proxy (eg, http://www.squid-cache.org)
   (suggested by Linder Erik)
+ use libConfuse (will break config file)
+ ability to specify preferred protocol (ssh/ftp) (Steve Grecni)
+ automatically retry failed download (bullet-proof transfers)
+ stop and retry transfer if it hangs (zero bytes in a configurable time)
+ IPv6 support, EPSV and EPRT support (RFC2428)
? option (in bookmarks?) to control LIST parameters (-a needed for PureFTPd)
? skiplist: add files/dirs which shouldn't be transfered (Marcus Schommer)
? if the LIST output can't be parsed, yafc should just dump it out raw.
? config option for default answers to questions (get/put/fxp/...)
? FTP over SSL/TLS support (rfc2228)


Legend:

* fix bug
+ add feature
? questionable
